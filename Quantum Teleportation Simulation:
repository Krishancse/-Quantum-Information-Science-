## Introduction

Quantum teleportation is a process by which the state of a qubit is transmitted from one location to another with the help of two entangled qubits and classical communication. This simulation aims to illustrate the steps involved in quantum teleportation and provide a visual representation of the quantum states throughout the process.

## Features

- Quantum circuit implementation of the teleportation protocol.
- Visualization of quantum states during the teleportation process.
- Classical communication channel simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.x)
- [Quantum Computing Framework](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/qiskit/getting-started.html) (e.g., Qiskit, Cirq)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-teleportation-simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd quantum-teleportation-simulation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
