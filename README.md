## Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Qiskit library (`pip install qiskit`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-teleportation-simulation.git
    cd quantum-teleportation-simulation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the quantum teleportation simulation, execute the following command:

```bash
